			<div class="mainidea">"Conflict"</div>

			<p>	Conflict in production relationships: the public interest & the private interests of clients and media</p>

			<p>To survive, design always has to neutralize the inheret conflict by adapting the socioeconomic circumstances/social orders as its own framework, which leaves less room for social engagement.</p>

		<span class="mainidea">By conforming to social orders</span>, design has contributed to symbolic production. "In this manner it legitimizes itself in the eyes of the established social order, which, in turn, is confirmed and legitimized by the contributions that design makes to symbolic production."</div>

	<span class="mainidea">"Symbolic Productions"</span> 
	<p> "As ideological instruments, they serve private interests that are preferably presented as universal ones." (ads commercials) The so-called dominant culture does not serve to intergrate different social classes, and contributes to creating a false sense of reality and hierarchies, which results in forcing all other culture to define themselves in the symbolism. </p>


	<span class="mainidea">the Reality and Symbolic Representation</span>
	<p> 
	 "A progressive staging of everyday life that gives rise to great tension between ethics and symbolism, because of the dissonance between the moral intentions related to reality and the generalizations and distinctions of established cultural production." </p>

			<span class="mainidea">“Mental Ecology”</span>
			<p>	to make an "independent and oppositional cultural production" is not to create an alternative within the the simulacrum of institutional culture/communicative order, but to creat something new. </p>

			<p>Designers "Communicative design, as reflexive practice, must be realistic in its social ambitions."</p>

			<p>
			Design should be commentary rather than self-defining. Designer should always be reflexive and hold oppositions to established social orders. And the reality is multidimensional. Always think outside of boxes.
			 "Design will have to get used to viewing substance, program, and style as ideological constructions, as expressions of restricted choices that only show a small sliver of reality in mediation."</p>
